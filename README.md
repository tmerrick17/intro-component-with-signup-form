## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

I completed this project a day after completing the [Base Apparel Project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-web-page-started-using-gulp-to-automate-processes-xO4guRw0z). 

This was crucial to understanding this one.  I built upon my understanding of validating inputs in a form.  It was very helpful to do this one after that project.  I'm trying to consume as much JavaScript as possible while still using my strong Sass skills.

### Continued development

I just need to keep working on JavaScript more and more.

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Client-side Form Validation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsd4FNGTRBw&t=1503s) - This was the primary Youtube video I used to help with the email verification.  Great resource!
- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJZv4d5rbIKd4QHMPkcABCw) - I watch his videos over and over again for great CSS/Sass tips and tricks.
